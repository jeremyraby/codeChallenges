## About

This is a collection of "code challenges" from SoloLearn's SQL certification course. Most of them are all single queries, but several skills
have been practiced in their completion. Please note that the tables have been recreated for this project as the tables in the course are pre-built and only shown as images. If you happen to go through the commit log, you'll see that I added the vast majority in one day; this is because I'd completed most of the course before getting the idea to add the challenges here to showcase my practice and development. 

## Skills Practiced

- Creating tables and inserting data
   - Primary Keys, AUTOINCREMENT, datatypes
- Altering and updating tables

- Comparing columns with GROUP BY
- Logical operators
